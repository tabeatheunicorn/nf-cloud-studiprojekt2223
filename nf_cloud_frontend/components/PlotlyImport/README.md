# Why does this folder exist?

Plotly comes in different sizes which mainly differ in the types of graphs that are available. Unfortunately, https://github.com/richnou/vue-plotly-basic/ only offers the very minimal version of this.
Treemap and other plots used in this project are not included.

This folder resembles the src/ directory of the aforementioned repo and differs in the plotly.js version that is imported. 

Please note that the author of this file didn't fully get which files are mandatory! Some imports still rely on the package build from this repo, so both need to be imported.
